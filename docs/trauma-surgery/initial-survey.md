# Initial or Primary Survey


Main causes of death in trauma are:

- airway obstruction
- respiratory failure
- hemorrhagic shock
- brain injury

And that is why we do a primary survey.

Here are some others:

- Airway obstruction
- Tension pneumothorax
- Massive internal or external hemorrhage
- Open pneumothorax
- Flail chest 
- Cardiac tamponade
- Intracranial bleed
- Increased intracranial pressure

## Alphabet Soup

### A: Airway with cervical spine precautions or protection.

When is an airway needed?

- patient is unconscious (GCS<8)
- severe inhalation injury
- physical obstruction from hematoma/emphysema

How is an airway obtained?

Most commonly orotracheal intubation, but can also be done with nasotracheal intubuation with a fiber optic bronchoscope -- especially if a subcutaneous emphysema in the neck is present! This is a sign of injury to the tracheobronchial tree. (This is just a fancy way of saying that some air has leaked into the subcu.)



### B: Breathing and Ventilation
### C: Circulation with hemorrhage control (basically sho**C**k)
	- in particular, circulation to the brain evaluated with **AVPU**
		- Alert
		- Verbal stimuli receptive
		- Painful stimuli receptive
		- Unresponsive to any

30% of blood can be lost before reduction in blood pressure...
- Preferred route of fluid resuscitation is 16 gauge peripheral IV's
- If they can't be inserted... then percutaneous femoral vein catheter or saphenous vein cut-down
	- In kids, intraosseus cannulation of proximal tibia!

Remember, any patient presenting with pale, cold extremities, is in **shock** until proven otherwise. 


With no obvious signs of hemorrhage, and when there is a hemodynamic compromise, a *pericardial tamponade* must be considered, and if suspected, corrected through the creation of a pericardial window. Tension pneumothorax must also be expected. These are usually caused by blunt/penetrating trauma to the chest.

**How can CVP be used to ddx shock?**

Low CVP = bleeding

High CVP = pericardial tamponade OR tension pneumothorax

```
But then how to ddx pericardial tamponade vs tension pneumothorax?

Tension pneumo = respiratory distress, assymmetric lung findings
Pericardial tamp = NO respiratory distress

This is important because of these diagnoses are CLINICAL, so do not order anything to make the call!

But afterwards...

Tension pneumo --> big needle/IV cath into pleural space --> chest tube 
Pericardial tamp --> evaluate pericardial sac (pericardiocentesis, thoracotomy, etc..)

```


### D: Disability (assessing neurologic status)

The Initial Two-Minute Neurological Assessment

- GCS.
- Pupil size, symmetry and reactivity to light.
- Equal movement in all four limbs?
- Biceps and knee jerk reflexes.
- Plantar responses.


### E: Exposure and Environmental Control

### The Kitchen Sink...

*All trauma patients should be getting supplemental oxygen.*

**ECG** for...

- dysrhythmias,
- STEMI,
- pulseless electrical activity (PEA)
- cardiac tamponade

**Urinary Catheter** for evaluating fluid status, but what you need to watch out for is...

- blood at meatus
- perineal ecchymosis
- high-riding prostate

**Gastric Catheter** for emptying the stomach to reduce the risk of aspiration.

**CXR** for pneumo/hemo-thorax and aortic injury.

**FAST** exam for finding fluid in the abdomen that could suggest *intra-abdominal bleeding* or *pericardial tamponade*.
